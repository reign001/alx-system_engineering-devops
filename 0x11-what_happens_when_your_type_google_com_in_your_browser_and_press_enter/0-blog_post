0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter
Our url (https://www.google.com) is sent to a DNS(Domain Name Server) which 
converts our url to a machine readable format known as IP. in the DNS there 
are four basic servers that aid the conversion of our url into an IP, these 
are; RECURSOR, ROOTNAME, TOP LEVEL DOMAIN and AUTHORITATIVE NAME SERVERS Once
the conversion is achieved, the IP is sent back to our local server through 
our IP. Computers communicate through IPs. IPs are like the phone number 
connected to every mobile phone. These IP communication is done through TCP a
concept in computer networks. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) which 
is a stateless protocol is a set of agreed upon standard for the transfer of 
information between systems. this (HTTPS) provides extra security for data 
transferred by encrypting them. HTTPS is basically HTTP with TLS/SSL encryption. 
the HTTP listens for incoming traffic on port 80, while the extra-security-padded 
HTTPS listen for incoming traffic on port 443. If the site we intend to access has 
a firewall nd load balancer, our request has to pass through them before getting to 
the web server, the application server and the database of the application we intend
to access. The Load Balancer actually acts as traffic control system, siting in front 
of the server-side servers, directing users requests to not so overloaded and most 
available servers. the firewalls on its own provide security for an internal server 
from the internet using a set of predefined rules. it scrutinizes every incoming traffic
to make sure that it meets the intended server's requirement. it is to the server 
what the white blood cell is to the human body. For the site we intend to access to 
be available, it must first be hosted on a web server. this is what accepts our url request
and returns our url in the form of a the HTML document. The web server is different
from the application server. while the web server serves the browser, the application
server serves the application, acting as a mediator between the complex users request
and the application code base and database. Having mentioned database, i think it is
worthy of brief discussion. i think the request to access a web application is simply a
request to access the information sitting on the applications information bank. this
information bank is what is referred to as a database. A database is a collection of
information which has been well structured, organized and stored electronically on a system. 
for information in a database to be accessed, a request is made through a Database Management 
System (DBMS). this DBMS is what divides our database into structured and non-structured.
